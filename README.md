## Description/Goals
This page allows myself or other users to display their resume,
contact information, current/ past projects, as well as 
 any web development projects they would like to showcase to the 
 public or possible employers. The main goal for the setup of my portfolio

 Giving any Employer a quick look into my experience or expertise so they may
 easily decide if I am the candidate they are worth pursing.
